# To-doApp

This is a prefatory to-do app developed using Anko and Kotlin in Android. 
New tasks can be added to the list. Once added you can delete a task or assign it a progress state.

The sole purpose of this Android app is to demonstrate Android development using Anko DSLs and Kotlin instead of using XML and Java.
